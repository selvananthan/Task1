JavaScript Objects
•	Are collections of key-value pairs.
•	Keys are strings; values can be various data types.

Internal Representation:
•	Managed by JavaScript engines like V8 or SpiderMonkey.
•	Typically use structures akin to hash tables for property access.
•	Employ hidden classes to optimize property addition and object structure.
•	Utilize inline caching to speed up repeated property access.

Optimization Techniques:
•	Hash tables enable efficient property lookup.
•	Hidden classes prevent slowdowns when adding new properties.
•	Inline caching optimizes access paths for frequently accessed properties.

Prototype-Based Language:
•	Objects inherit from other objects via the prototype chain.
•	Property lookups traverse up the chain if the property isn't on the object itself.

Conclusion:
•	Objects are dynamic and optimized for performance.
•	Understanding these concepts can lead to more efficient JavaScript coding.
