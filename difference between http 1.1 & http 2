differance between http/1.1 and http/2.
HTTP/1.1:
1.	Introduced in 1997.
2.	Supports persistent connections for multiple requests over a single connection.
3.	Allows pipelining of requests to reduce latency.
4.	Faces issues like head-of-line blocking, causing delays.
HTTP/2:
1.	Standardized in 2015, evolved from the SPDY protocol.
2.	Uses a binary protocol, which is more efficient.
3.	Implements multiplexing to handle multiple requests and responses simultaneously, eliminating head-of-line blocking.
4.	Features header compression (HPACK) to reduce redundant header information.
5.	Introduces server push to proactively send resources to the client’s cache.
Impact on Web Development:
1.	Leads to improved page load times.
2.	Simplifies resource delivery and potentially reduces front-end code complexity.
3.	Often used with HTTPS for enhanced security.
Conclusion:
1.	The transition to HTTP/2 offers a faster, more secure, and reliable web experience.
2.	HTTP/2’s adoption is beneficial for both users and developers.
